# Pinet

Yet another documentation template for jsdocs

## Why?

I had already used docdash but had to fork and make some hefty changes to get it _just_ the way I wanted it, which led me to the route of why not sport my own?

And so Pinet came to pass! It has it's own built in template engine!

## Current State: In Development

Pinet has just started life, so I recommend avoiding usage right now.

## Features

- Modern, minimalist design for easy to read flow
- Mobile responsive
- Built in support for `category` and `signature` tags
- More to come

## Template Engine

The built in engine is based around using functions!

_Example coming soon_
