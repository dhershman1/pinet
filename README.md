# Pinet

Yet another documentation template for jsdocs

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

## Why?

I had already used docdash but had to fork and make some hefty changes to get it _just_ the way I wanted it, which led me to the route of why not sport my own?

And so Pinet came to pass! It has it's own built in template engine!

## Current State: Prepping For a Beta Release

Pinet is getting closer to releasing a 0.1.0 version! Feel free to play around with the code with your projects and report any strange activity or bugs you might find, I appreciate it!

## Features

- Modern, minimalist design for easy to read flow

- More to come

## Template Engine

The built in engine is based around using functions!
